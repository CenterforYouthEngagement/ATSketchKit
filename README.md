#ATSketchKit
ATSketchKit is a drawing, or sketching framework for iOS written in Swift 2.

It can be used as the foundation for an artistic app, a simple signature feature or more inteligent graph designing app.

## Intentions & License
My intentions with this framework are to enable people to produce more drawing apps on iOS, give my two cents worth of examples on how to code in swift on iOS and ignite the conversation and contributions around this particular technology (especially around pattern recognitions & and visual smoothing)

For full license please see [license.md](license.md)

## Content
ATSketchKit contains:

- the ATSketchKit Framework which contains all you need to start drawing
- The ATSketchKit Demo app which shows an example on how to use the framework.
- Unit and UI Tests.

## Usage
Using ATSketchKit is as easy as:

- Create your app project in Xcode
- Load the ATSketchKit framework inside your project
- Add a ATSketchView where you see fit
- Have the controler responsible for the ATSkethView configure the ATSketchView depending on your needs at the time.
